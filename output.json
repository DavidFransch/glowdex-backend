{"text":"This grid cell (ID 20117, Australia) is classified within Typology 5, labeled as 'Refuges', and more specifically within Sub-Typology 8 of the Global Coastal Wetlands Index (Sievers et al., 2021).\n\nThis typology generally represents coastal wetland areas that exhibit relatively lower human impacts and tend to support robust ecological conditions (Sievers et al., 2021). Sub-Typology 8 is specifically characterized as representing important coastal wetland refuges from human impacts (Sievers et al., 2021).\n\nCompared to many other global coastal wetland areas, sites within Typology 5, and particularly Sub-Typology 8, tend to have relatively lower marine-based cumulative impacts on both mangrove and seagrass habitats (Sievers et al., 2021). Mangrove habitats in these areas also exhibit relatively lower land-based impacts and a low rate of increase in marine-based impacts (Sievers et al., 2021). Furthermore, mangroves in this typology are associated with a relatively high above-ground biomass, high fish and invertebrate density, and a high species threat score, indicating a lower proportion of threatened species compared to other typologies (Sievers et al., 2021).\n\nThis typology is commonly associated with conditions of relatively lower human-induced pressures (Sievers et al., 2021). For both mangroves and seagrass, there are comparatively low marine-based cumulative impacts, which can include pressures such as fishing and shipping (Sievers et al., 2021). Mangroves also experience lower land-based impacts, which can include organic chemical and nutrient pollution (Sievers et al., 2021). The ecological conditions commonly associated with this typology for mangroves include a relatively high density of fish and invertebrates, and a lower proportion of species threatened with extinction (Sievers et al., 2021).\n\n### References\n\nSievers, M., Brown, C.
