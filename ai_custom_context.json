{"text":"This grid cell (ID 99001) in TestCountry is classified within Typology 5, which is broadly described as a 'Refuge' area for coastal wetlands.\n\nThis typology generally represents regions where coastal wetlands, specifically mangroves in this cell, experience relatively lower human-induced pressures and exhibit healthier ecological conditions compared to many other global coastal areas.\n\nSites in Typology 5 tend to differ from others globally by having:\n*   **Lower impacts:** They are associated with relatively low marine-based impacts and low land-based impacts on mangroves. In contrast, other typologies might be characterized by relatively high land- and marine-based impacts or high climate-based impacts (Sievers et al., 2021).\n*   **Higher ecological health:** For mangroves, this typology is associated with relatively high Above Ground Biomass (AGB), high fish and invertebrate density, and a high species threat score, indicating a lower proportion of threatened species (Sievers et al., 2021).\n\nThe common pressures or conditions associated with this typology for mangroves include:\n*   **Low marine-based cumulative impacts:** These are pressures originating from the marine environment (Sievers et al., 2021).\n*   **Low land-based cumulative impacts:** These are pressures originating from land (Sievers et al., 2021).\n*   **Favorable ecological structure and function:** Mangroves in these areas tend to have robust physical structure (high AGB) and support abundant marine life (high fish and invertebrate density), with a relatively low proportion of species threatened with extinction (Sievers et al., 2021).\n\n---\nReferences\n\nSievers, M., Brown, C.
