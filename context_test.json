{"text":"For Grid Cell ID 20117 in Australia, assigned to Typology 5, \"Refuges\":\n\nThis typology generally represents coastal wetland areas that function as important ecological refuges globally (Sievers et al., 2021).\n\nSites within this typology tend to differ from many other global coastal wetland areas by experiencing relatively lower human-driven pressures. For this cell, which contains mangroves and seagrass, this means it is characterized by relatively low marine-based impacts on both mangroves and seagrass, and low land-based impacts on mangroves (Sievers et al., 2021).\n\nThese lower pressures are commonly associated with favorable ecological conditions. For mangroves, this typology is linked to relatively high above-ground biomass, high densities of fish and invertebrates, and a low proportion of threatened species (Sievers et al., 2021).\n\n### References\nSievers, M., Brown, C.
